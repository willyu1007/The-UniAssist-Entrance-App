# AI Assistant Instructions

**AI-Friendly Repository Template**: a starter kit for creating LLM-optimized codebases with optional features.

## Project Type

Template repository. Users clone the repository to start new AI-friendly projects.

## Key Directories

| Directory | Purpose | Entry Point |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `init/` | Project initialization | `init/AGENTS.md` |
| `init/_tools/feature-docs/` | Optional feature documentation | `init/_tools/feature-docs/README.md` |
| `.ai/` | Skills, scripts, LLM governance | `.ai/AGENTS.md` |
| `dev-docs/` | Complex task documentation | `dev-docs/AGENTS.md` |
| `.codex/` | Codex skill stubs (generated) | - |
| `.claude/` | Claude skill stubs (generated) | - |

## Routing

| Task Type | Entry Point |
|-----------|-------------|
| **First time / Project setup** | `init/AGENTS.md` |
| **Skill authoring / maintenance** | `.ai/AGENTS.md` |
| **LLM engineering** | `.ai/llm-config/AGENTS.md` |
| **Project progress governance** | `.ai/project/AGENTS.md` |
| **Complex task documentation** | `dev-docs/AGENTS.md` |

## Global Rules

- Follow progressive disclosure: read only the file you are routed to
- On context reset for ongoing work, read `dev-docs/active/<task-name>/00-overview.md` first

## Coding Standards (RECOMMEND)

- **ESM (.mjs)**: All scripts in the repository use ES Modules with `.mjs` extension. Use `import`/`export` syntax, not `require()`.

## Coding Workflow (MUST)

- Before modifying code/config for a non-trivial task, apply the Decision Gate in `dev-docs/AGENTS.md` and create/update the dev-docs task bundle as required.
- If the user asks for planning artifacts (plan/roadmap/milestones/implementation plan) before coding:
  - If the task meets the Decision Gate, use `plan-maker` first, then ask for confirmation to proceed with implementation.
  - If the task is trivial (<30 min), provide an in-chat plan (do NOT write under `dev-docs/`).
  - If the task needs context preservation (multi-session, handoff) or qualifies as complex, follow `dev-docs/AGENTS.md` and use dev-docs workflows.

## Workspace Safety (MUST)

- NEVER create/copy/clone this repository into any subdirectory of itself (no nested repo copies).
- Create throwaway test repos **outside** the repo root (OS temp or a sibling directory) and delete them after verification.
- Keep temporary workspaces shallow: if a path is getting deeply nested or has exceeded **12 path segments** total;, stop and clean up instead of continuing.

<!-- DB-SSOT:START -->
## Database SSOT and schema synchronization

The section is **managed by the init pipeline**. After project initialization it will contain:

- The selected DB schema SSOT mode (`none` / `repo-prisma` / `database`)
- The correct routing for DB schema change requests
- The canonical LLM-readable DB schema contract location

If the block is still in its placeholder form, run the init Stage C apply step.
