<!--
LLM rules:
- Render this file in the user-confirmed language stored at: init/_work/.init-state.json -> llm.language
- Keep the top section one-screen readable (aim <= ~60 lines).
- Do not include explicit SSOT mapping tables.
- Keep status values as literals: todo | confirmed | tbd (do not translate).
- On stage start (A->B, B->C, C->complete): roll up the finished stage into Archive and reset the top focus.
