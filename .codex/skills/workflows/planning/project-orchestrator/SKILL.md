name: project-orchestrator
description: Project-level orchestrator for intake and continuity. Turns a new/ongoing request into a governance decision (reuse vs new task, mapping to Milestone/Feature/Requirement) and keeps the project hub consistent (registry/changelog/derived views). Focuses on planning and coordination, not product code changes.
