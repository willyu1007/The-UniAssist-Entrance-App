Canonical source: `.ai/skills/workflows/documentation/docs/`

Open `.ai/skills/workflows/documentation/docs/SKILL.md` and any supporting files referenced there (for example `reference.md`, `examples.md`, `scripts/`, `templates/`).

> **Note**: The frontmatter above is identical to the canonical source except for `ssot_path` and `category` which are added for navigation. After opening the source file, skip re-reading the description to avoid redundant token usage.
