# Deployment Handbook

## Purpose
Store deployment planning notes and runbooks under `ops/deploy/handbook/`.

## What belongs here
- Environment-specific decisions (namespaces, domains, rollout strategy)
- Scaling and reliability notes
- Runbooks and procedures (human-run)

## Subdirectories
- `runbooks/`: operational procedures and guides

## Boundaries
- No secrets (tokens/keys/credentials) in docs.
- Execution entry points should live under `ops/deploy/scripts/` (not inside handbook).
