# Context Awareness - Operating Guide (Reference)

## Design goals

- **Stable entry point**: `docs/context/INDEX.md` and `docs/context/registry.json` are the supported context entry points.
- **Verifiable updates**: artifact checksums enable CI to detect edits that bypass the scripts.
- **Tool-agnostic artifacts**: OpenAPI, BPMN 2.0, and a normalized DB schema mapping.

## ctl-context responsibilities

`ctl-context` is a **registry management tool**:

- **Register**: add/remove artifacts to `docs/context/registry.json`
- **Checksum**: compute and update SHA-256 checksums via `touch`
- **Verify**: check file existence and checksum consistency

`ctl-context` does **NOT**:

- Execute shell commands or generators
- Auto-regenerate artifacts from source

## Contract mode vs Generated mode

### Contract mode (recommended default)

- The artifact file is the authoritative contract.
- Human collaborators and LLMs edit the file directly.
- After edits, run:
  - `node .ai/skills/features/context-awareness/scripts/ctl-context.mjs touch`
  - `node .ai/skills/features/context-awareness/scripts/ctl-context.mjs verify --strict`

### Generated mode (opt-in)

- The artifact file is generated by **external tools** (e.g., OpenAPI generators, Prisma, custom scripts).
- Register the artifact with `mode=generated`.
- Workflow:
  1. Run your external generator tool manually or via CI
  2. Run `ctl-context touch` to update checksums
  3. Run `ctl-context verify --strict` to confirm consistency

> **Note**: `ctl-context` does not provide auto-execution of generator commands.
> The `source.command` field in registry is for **documentation only**.

## Recommended CI gates

Minimum:

- `node .ai/skills/features/context-awareness/scripts/ctl-context.mjs verify --strict`
- `node .ai/scripts/ctl-project-state.mjs verify`

For generated mode artifacts, run your generators **before** the verify step.

## Common artifact types

- `openapi`: API surface contract (`docs/context/api/openapi.yaml`)
- `db-schema`: normalized DB structure mapping (`docs/context/db/schema.json`)
- `bpmn`: BPMN 2.0 process file (`docs/context/process/*.bpmn`)

## Troubleshooting

- **Checksum mismatch**: you edited an artifact but did not run `ctl-context touch`.
- **Missing file**: registry references a path that does not exist; create the file or remove the registry entry via script.
